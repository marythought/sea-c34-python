Hi, I'm Kim!

##Some things about me##

I'm a meteorologist! I went to college in Arizona where I got my degree and then moved up here to go to grad school at the UW. I'm currently on a leave of absence because I got an *amazing* opportunity to work at a company in the city that provides forecasts for renewable energy sites. I'm currently working as their data analyst- basically I get to code up things all day to process, store, and glean knowledge from meteorological data. I don't think I'll be a forecaster, but I still am a huge weather lover.  

I'm in this class because, career wise, I think I'd like to transition to a job that allows me to code a lot more. My current Python knowledge extends to what I need to do to process data- I'd like to have a more comprehensive knowledge of the language. 

###Random tidbits###
I grew up in Boston. You may hear my accent. I love spinning. It's my favorite form of exercise. I love Mexican food. Do you know a good place in Seattle? Please tell me, I'm always looking for more. I don't like coconuts, pickles, or olives. I really love hiking- [this one](http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/wallace-falls) is my favorite. Here's a ridiculous photo of me standing inside a tornado machine at Science World in Vancouver:
