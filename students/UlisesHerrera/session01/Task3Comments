DeniseBarnes:

While your some of your code (with proper commeting) will cause exceptions when we run 'break_me.py'; note that Task 3 requests that these exceptions happen when a function (written especifically for each exception) is called. But you've done about half the work required already, so you're almost there. Make these changes and I'll update your grade.


In addition:

Line 6: Please write a function that when called, will return an AttributeError.

Line 10: This function does not return a NameError, it returns a SyntaxError.

Line 15: This IS a NameError. But not because of line 14; Can you tell why?

Remember: A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. And that action (function execution) can only happen by `calling` it.

For example:


# The next line of code defines a function.
def my_function():
    a = 1 + 2
    print a

# The next line `calls` my_function.
my_function()
