#Hi there,

My name is Michael Hazani and this is the first time I've heard of Markdown. Quite a useful tool! Evidently it lets you:

1. Make lists
2. Do many other things, *probably*.

Anyway.

###The story of my Life thus Far
Is not something particularly relevant for this class, but can be briefly summed up by:

* | Composing and songwriting | Coding | Both
--- | --- | ---
  |Makes **right** brain happy | Makes **left** brain happy | Both hemispheres can sleep at night

 [This is my music](http://qvalia.co "QVALIA")

 [This is my codingStuff (new and perpetually under construction, imagine geocities-style construction worker gif)](http://michaelhazani.net "Michael Hazani's Homepage")


#####*sleep is important, kids*.
