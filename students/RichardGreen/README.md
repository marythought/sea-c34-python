Hi my name is Rich Green.

##A few paragraphs about myself

### About Me
I've lived in the northwest over ten years. Originally from Hamden CT, I moved out here for college and never left. Have always been interested in computing.

### What am I doing ?
I am currently a bioinformaticist . Which is a cross between a molecular biologist, data scientist , and a software engineer. Problem is I've always felt I lacked in computing. Took courses in C, Java, and Python previously but It never seems to stick.
