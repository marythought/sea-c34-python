##About Me

Prior to this class, I was in the game industry for a decade and a half. I started as a digital artist at a small studio in Lemont, IL. When I came to Washington, I transitioned into a designer role, mostly working on games for portable systems like the Nintendo DS and later on, iPhone and Android. Trust me, it's not as exciting as it sounds; most of my job involved writing documentation, creating spreadsheets, and debating gameplay decisions in meetings.

But occasionally, I'd get to use scripting languages like Lua to program character behavior, make cutscene sequences, and occasionally even create tools for other designers to use. Over the years, I came to realize this was my favorite part of the job, and something I wanted to do all the time. The games themselves had become secondary. What I really cared about was getting my hands dirty and solving problems.

So here I am! I'm not entirely sure what domain I want to go into, whether it be web development, enterprise, or what-have-you. I'm hoping that CodeFellows will let me try out a bunch of different technologies and help me chart out a career transition. Python seemed ideal for this, as it's used in all kinds of industries.

Other stuff I'm into: writing, cooking, debating the relative merits of speculative fiction universes. And I still paint (very) occasionally, check out my gallery below!
