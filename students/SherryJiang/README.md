# Sherry Jiang: Bio

I'm from California, and just moved to Seattle 8 months ago after graduating from the University of California, Berkeley. I currently work for Amazon as a Business Analyst. In my free time, I enjoy running, playing soccer and playing piano. I'm really excited to be a part of this class and learn how to start building projects in Python!

# Three Facts About Myself:
* I have better than perfect vision
* I've been to 11 countries
* I've done 4 half marathons and am training for my first one in June
