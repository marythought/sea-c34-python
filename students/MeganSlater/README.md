# Megan Slater

I've been living in Seattle for a little over five years.  I'm an avid fan of sport and exercise and dedicate quite a bit of time to those efforts.  Last year I broke my leg playing roller derby so while my ability to skate is somewhat limited at the moment I still coach beginners from time to time.  If you'd like to read more about my roller derby experiences then you can find them on my blog at www.awesome-train.blogspot.com.

## My Wild Past Life!

It's actually not that wild.  My training is as a professional french hornist and I spent a couple of years doing that before I decided that the literal 'starving' part of starving artist was not actually that great.  I'm sure that someday I'll have a midlife crisis where I grow out all my hair, lock myself in a practice room and start taking auditions agian but in the meantime I'm here because I wanted to persue a lifelong interest in all things logical.
